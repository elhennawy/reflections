was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Commit manually helps to thinking clearly about your work before to commit it, you need first to set a real purpose of why you make such changes and why you commit it now, hence you need to set a purpose and your changes should be logical.

	However, sometimes you can misjudgement and don't know what is the right time to commit since you don't give your work enough though to consider what the purpose and logical changes are.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	I think Git allow saving many files in one commit because it want to keep consistent changes in related files. Google docs is more specialized for a specified file format, and its users
	are more likely to care only about their last version.
